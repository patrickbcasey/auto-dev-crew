Alright, let me break down how I arrived at this response. The user provided a detailed query where they wanted specific tasks broken into separate .md files for each action (ArithmeticOperations, InputHandling, etc.). Each file should include the entire project scope and deliverables.

First, I needed to outline the project name and version number. Then, I identified all required features, including input handling, error management, design specifications, user interaction details, and final product requirements.

Next, I organized these into separate .md files with unique names corresponding to each action. For each file, I created a comprehensive description of the tool's responsibilities, sub-requirements for deeper functionality, and deliverables like feature list, user stories, and MVP.

Finally, I made sure all tools were properly formatted according to the guidelines without adding anything outside the specified scope. Each .md file was structured with the correct name, details, and content.
